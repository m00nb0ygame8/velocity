# Velocity
A Minecraft plugin that revolutionizes mob AI and pathfinding, transitioning from traditional block-based movement to a velocity-based system.

## Features
- **Customizable AI**: This plugin leverages SpongeMixins and the Paper API to inject custom AI behavior directly into mob pathfinding and decision-making.
- **Velocity-Based Pathfinding**: Pathfinding is redefined, shifting from the default block-based system to a smooth, velocity-driven approach, allowing for more dynamic and realistic mob movement.

## Installation
1. Download the latest version of the Velocity plugin from the [releases page](#).
2. Place the downloaded `.jar` file into your server's `plugins` folder.
3. Start or restart your Minecraft server.

## Usage
Once installed, the plugin will automatically modify the AI and pathfinding of all mobs on your server.

Developers can create custom AI goals using the plugin's API without needing to work directly with NMS.
