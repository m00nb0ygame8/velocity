## Velocity
A Minecraft plugin that changes the way the mob ai works and how its pathfinding works as well.


# Features
This plugin takes advantage of SpongeMixins and the PaperApi to inject code into mob's ai step to allow for custom ai.

This plugin changes how pathfinding works to switched from block based to a purely velocity based system.
